# OEIS as continued fractions

The greatest integer sequence is:

A095646 (https://oeis.org/A095646)

## What? Why?

Here I interpret integer sequences as continued fraction.

After being inspired by Ron Knott's website
(http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/cfINTRO.html)
I figured that instead of finding continued fractions converging on a known number,
it is possible to interpret arbitrary integer sequences as a continued fraction.
And what better way to get sequences than the OEIS (https://oeis.org/)?

In that way, we can associate a real number with (almost?) every integer sequence.
That allows us (for example) to define an ordering on the sequences
so that we can finally answer which sequence is truly the greatest.

Use `main.py` (and download https://oeis.org/stripped.gz) to find all numbers.
